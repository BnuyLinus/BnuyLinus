Haii I'm Linus, a techie bunny with memory issues beyond just my Computer. Currently in an apprenticeship as an IT-specialist for system-integration here in Germany, I'm honing my skills in mostly Admin-related stuff, delving into realms like scripting, automation, networking, and Linux wizardry. While I may not be an expert just yet,
I'm definitely on the journey of continuous learning.

I had a year-long adventure with Java,
but the experience left me a bit traumatized, so instead I took on Python at home and automation scripts such as YAML (Ansible), HCL (Terraform), 
or good old bash at work, they are all way more readable in my opinion. 

If you'd like to connect, whether for a casual chat or to share your thoughts on my arguably written code, feel free to add 'catlinus' on Discord.
