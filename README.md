Haii I'm Linus, a techie bunny with memory issues beyond just my Computer. Currently in an apprenticeship as an IT-specialist for system-integration here in Germany, I'm honing my skills in mostly Admin-related stuff, delving into realms like scripting, automation, networking, and Linux wizardry. While I may not be an expert just yet,
I'm definitely on the journey of continuous learning.

I had a year-long adventure with Java,
but the experience left me a bit traumatized, steering me towards the welcoming embrace of languages like Python and automation scripts such as YAML (Ansible), HCL (Terraform), 
or good old bash â€“ they align more with my preferences and abilities.

If you'd like to connect, whether for a casual chat or to share your thoughts on my arguably written code, feel free to add 'catlinus' on Discord.
